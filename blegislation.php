                    <h3><strong>From Take-Down Duties to Obligations to Uphold Free Speech</strong></h3>
                    <p>Calls for harder regulation of social media platforms have echoed worldwide for a while. In particular, the effect of platformsâ€™ content moderation on freedom of expression has recently engaged lawmakers in Europe and the US. What is particularly salient with this fresh wave of social media legislation is that it does not just require platforms to remove specific content. On the contrary, the novel social media laws can demand that platforms do not remove particular content. This blog post will present the recent social media laws adopted in Europe and the US that protect usersâ€™
                        free speech exercise against platforms and discuss the challenges they face in the coming year.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Platform Laws in the Limelight on Both Sides of the Atlantic</strong></h3>
                    <p>In Europe, the EU adopted the Digital Services Act (DSA) in 2022. The regulation imposes various duties related to content moderation on social media
                        platforms and will become fully effective in February 2024.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are several ways in which the DSA safeguards usersâ€™ free speech interests against platforms. It imposes obligations on platforms to include clear information about content restrictions in their terms of service and pay due regard to free speech rights of users when applying and enforcing these restrictions (Art. 14). Platforms must also provide a statement of reasons to users whose content has been restricted or whose account has been suspended or terminated (Art. 17). Furthermore, platforms are required to set up an internal complaint-handling system, which
                        nables users to complain about platformsâ€™ decisions to limit their content or accounts (Art. 20).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the US, legislative offensives against social media platforms accelerated after the major platforms blocked former president Donald Trump from their services in January 2021 following the storming of the US Capitol in Washington, D.C. Two social media laws that have received the most attention are the bills passed by lawmakers in Florida and Texas in 2021.</p>
